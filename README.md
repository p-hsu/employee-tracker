## Project overview

![Employee Database](./assets/images/app-banner.png)

This application allows the ability to view, manage, and make modifications to staffing structure for organizations/businesses, otherwise known as C.M.S - Content Management Systems. Using the command line, users can choose options through prompts to manipulate a databse.

### Project Status:

This project is completed and functional.

#### Issues to debug:
* providing a "Quit" option but application doesn't actually exit?
* `updateManager`: pulled employees that are managers to provide user options BUT
    - picking one option sends back an ERROR message
    - picking the other option will follow through with the function but manager will fill in as NULL in database
    - **THIS WAS A BONUS FUNCTION FOR THE ASSIGNMENT**

:: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED ::
